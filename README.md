# Welcome to Mega Savings!
 ## Where We Pump Prices Down to Fill Up Your Tank
 
For this project I will be using the following to create a gas station coupon website (If you are wondering why, it's because the prices triggered me this morning when I had to fill up my tank):

- HTML
- CSS

## The Pitch 

The gas prices are going up and the community has spoken! *Mega Savings* has teamed up with Walmart to bring you gas a discounted rates. 

# Conclusion 
Later this week I will be using flex box to improve the design and functionality of the site. 


This website was built outside of The Odin Project Curriculum using youtube.
